# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
##  Lucas Hofmann

I am a freelance photographer and have always wanted to learn more web design as it will greatly help me in my work.

But what exactly is the internet? I was interested to learn:

* The internet was first created under the name ARANET for use by the Department of Defense.

* The first computer used for functioning the internet can now be seen on display in a museum in London.

* I learned that the ISP is to the web address much like our personal phone numbers are linked to us. You can not call the name, you call the phone number associated with the name.
