 #Project-2 Tech Report:
 _____________________________________________

 So far HTML has been challenging as this all new for me. I have to watch a-lot of additional tutorials, I am starting to get fairly confidant with the process. I can not believe how much I have already learned! I am loving this so far!

 I am excited to learn more advanced techniques and CSS!

 For this Project I tried and focused on one page at a time. My mind wanted to bounce from the about to index and back and forth. Just gotta work the steps.
