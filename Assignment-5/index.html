Dear Chicago,
You'll never guess
You know the girl you said I'd meet someday?
Well I got something to confess,
She picked me up on Friday,
Asked me if she reminded me of you?

I just laughed and lit a cigarette,
Said That's impossible to do.
Life's gotten simple since
And it fluctuates so much,
Happy and sad and back again
I'm not crying now too much.

I think about you all the time,
It's strange and hard to deal
I think about you lying there,
And those blanket's lie so still.

Nothing breathes here in the cold,
Nothing moves or even smiles,
I've been thinking some of suicide,
But there's bars out here for miles.
Sorry about the every kiss,
Every kiss you wasted bad.I think the thing you said was true
I'm gonna die alone and sad.

The wind's feelin' real these days,
Yeah and baby it hurts me some,
Never thought I'd feel so blue,
New York City you're almost gone.

I think that I've fallen out of love,
I think I've fallen out of love,
I think I've fallen out of love, with you
