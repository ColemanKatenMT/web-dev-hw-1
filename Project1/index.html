  <pre> Go placidly amid the noise
     and the haste, and remember what
     peace there may be in silence.
     As far as possible, without surrender
     , be on good terms with all persons.
     speak your truth quietly and cleary;
     and listen to others, even the dull
     and the ignorant; they too have thier
     story. Avoid loud and aggressive
     persons; they are vexatious to the
     spirit. If you compare yourself with
     others, you may become vain or bitter
     for always there will be greater and
     lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy
     your achievements as well as your
     plans. Keep interested in your own
     career, however humble; it is a real
     possession in the changing fortunes
     of time.
